Given an integer x, find 2 integers a and b such that:

1 ≤ a,b ≤ x
b divides a (a is divisible by b).
a⋅b > x.
a/b < x.
Input
The only line contains the integer x (1≤x≤100).

Output
You should output two integers a and b, satisfying the given conditions, separated by a space. If no pair of integers satisfy the conditions above, print "-1" (without quotes).
